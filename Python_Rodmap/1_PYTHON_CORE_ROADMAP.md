Python Core Mastery Roadmap (20/80 Rule)
Phase 1: The Syntax Foundation
Focus: Data types and basic logic.

[ ] Primitive Data Types

Strings (Indexing, Slicing, and Methods)

Integers & Floats

Booleans

[ ] String Interpolation

F-Strings (Formatted Strings)

[ ] Basic Operators

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, //, %)

Comparison (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

Logical (and, or, not)

Phase 2: Data Structures
Focus: Managing collections of data (Crucial for JSON/APIs).

[ ] Lists

Creation, Appending, and Removing elements

Iterating through lists

List Comprehension (Basic filtering)

[ ] Dictionaries

Key-Value pairs access

Adding/Updating keys

Nested Dictionaries (Accessing data inside complex structures)

[ ] Sets & Tuples

Removing duplicates (Sets)

Immutable sequences (Tuples)

Phase 3: Control Flow & Logic
Focus: Decision making and repetition.

[ ] Conditional Logic

if, elif, else statements

[ ] Loops

for loops (Iterating over sequences)

while loops (Basic conditional execution)

break and continue statements

Phase 4: Functional Programming & Scope
Focus: Code reusability and organization.

[ ] Functions

Defining functions (def)

Arguments and Keyword Arguments (args, kwargs)

Return values

[ ] Scope

Global vs. Local variables

[ ] Built-in Functions

len(), type(), range(), enumerate(), zip()

Phase 5: Error Handling & Modules
Focus: Making code resilient and modular.

[ ] Exception Handling

try, except, finally blocks

Handling specific errors (e.g., KeyError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError)

[ ] Modules & Packages

import statements

Standard Libraries: os, sys, json, datetime

[ ] Environment Management

Creating and managing Virtual Environments (venv)

Using pip and requirements.txt
